# pixelEditor

Simple app for creating pixel art. It is created and suited for my needs - spirtes with max dimensions of 36 x 36 px (very hard to draw)
and one special case of 36 x 54 pixels for trees and other tall objects. I use ENDESGA 16 palette (https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga16)
as basic palette with option to customize it - add or delete colors.
